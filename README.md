# Environmental Impact of Food Production <br><br/>

This app provides insight on environmental impact of food production. Main take-away is that food production' contributes to CO2 emissions represents around 26% worldwide. Top animal-based emitter - beef, produces more than 3 times more emissions than top vegetal-based emitter - dark chocolate!!! <br/>


The app is my take on existing project (see Inspiration section) published in Dash Gallery. I wanted to show that it's relatively easy to create appealing app in streamlit. <br/>

The code is simple and easy to follow and contains only 172 rows - including description and gaps and code on multiple lines. <br/>
